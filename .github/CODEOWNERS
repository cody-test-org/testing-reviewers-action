# CODEOWNERS file for dummy-repo
# This file defines who owns different parts of the codebase.
# 
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# These owners will be the default assignees for pull requests
# containing changes to the matching files.
#
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes precedence.
# For more information, see:
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# Global default owners - fallback for any files not covered below
